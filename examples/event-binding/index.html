		<h2>Event Binding</h2>
		<p>
			Sub-views and collections can have their events automatically bubbled up to the parent view referenced by their alias.  Parent views can also use
			the <em>events</em> hash to bind to events fired by the parent itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h3>View Events</h3>
			View events can be referenced in the view events hash (convenient if a parent class is triggering the event) by providing the view event name
			as the events hash key.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h3>View Model</h3>
			If the model is set on the view using the <em>model</em> constructor property or by using the <em>setModel</em> method of the view, the model
			events can be bound using the <em>model</em> prefix within view events.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h3>View Collections</h3>
			Any collection set on the view using <em>addCollection</em> with an <em>alias</em> value will have the collection events available in the view events
			hash using the alias prefix.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h3>Sub Views</h3>
			Any sub-view set on the view using <em>addView</em> with an <em>alias</em> value will have the view events available in the view events
			hash using the alias prefix.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h3>Event Hierarchy</h3>
			The ':' character in the event key can also be referenced as a parent object within the events hash. So, the following event bindings are equal:
<pre>
events: {
	foo: {
		event1: 'onEvent1',
		event2: 'onEvent2'
	}
}
</pre>
and
<pre>
events: {
	'foo:event1': 'onEvent1',
	'foo:event2: 'onEvent2'
}
</pre>
		</p>
		
		Below is an example of view, sub-view, model, collection and DOM event bindings
		<pre class="code">
...
events: {
	'viewEvent': 'onViewEvent', // bind to the 'viewEvent' event triggered from the same view that the events hash is registered
	'myView:someEvent',	// bind to the 'someEvent' event triggered from a sub-view added using the 'myView' alias
	'myCollection:reset', // bind to the 'reset' event triggered from a collection added using the 'myCollection' alias
	'model:all', // bind to all events triggered from the model set on the view
	'click button' // bind to the click event on any 'button' element found within this view's root element
}
		</pre>
